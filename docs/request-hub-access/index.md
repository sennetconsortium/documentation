# How to request access to the Dell Innovation "Moonshot" Hub

The Dell Innovation Hub is a small cluster used by SenNet for compute and data storage. Access to these resources and
SenNet data is limited to users with University of Pittsburgh sponsored accounts who are a funded member of
the [SenNet Consortium](https://sennetconsortium.org). Requests to access the SenNet data and compute resources on the
Hub must be approved by the SenNet CODCC PI and CRIO.

Protected genomic data is included in this access. Consequently, users requesting access must agree to adhere to
protected genomic data policies of SenNet and have applicable CITI training.

In order to maintain the secure nature of the system and its data, the list of users with access will be reviewed every
90 days. If it is determined that a user no longer requires access, their access will be terminated.

To initiate a request send an email to the <a href="mailto:crio@pitt.edu">Research Informatics Office (
crio@pitt.edu)</a> with the following information:

- That you are requesting access to SenNet resources on the "Moonshot" Hub
- The name of the funded SenNet component that you work for
- A description of why you need access
- Which role you are requesting access as. Choose one of:
    - **Pipeline Debugger** - A user who needs read access to all project data (including protected data) and pipeline
      logs.
    - **Application and Data Admin** - A user who needs read/write access to all project data (including protected data)
      and ability to install/update/troubleshoot the project specific applications and services.
    - **System Admin** - A user who needs access to install/update/configure system level applications and services. The
      user will be granted root access across all data transfer nodes (DTNs), project specific machines like SenNet DEV
      VM (vm05) and PROD VM (vm06) and all compute nodes. This user will have read/write access to protected data across
      all projects.
