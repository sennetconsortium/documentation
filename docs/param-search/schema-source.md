# SenNet Source schema

## Overview:
This page describes the Source attributes available for querying via the [SenNet parameterized search endpoint](/param-search).  Full Source schema information can be found at the [SenNet Search API documentation page](https://smart-api.info/ui/10ed9b5eb8ff960d4431befc591ed842) at the bottom of the page in the `Schemas` section under the Source section.
This page describes the Source schema for SenNet data. Source data may be returned itself or a part of another entity.  For example, this endpoint searches Sources :
```
GET https://search.api.sennetconsortium.org/param-search/sources?group_name=TMC%20-%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University
```

## Description: 
A query string is built by combining schema elements documented below with matching values.  Each "term" of the query is combined using the & character, and the entire query is attached to the base URL after a ? character, per web standards.

Query terms may be composited from attributes deeper in the schema type of an attribute.  For example, the Source Schema attribute ```metadata.living_source_data``` has a type of Source Metadata Schema, and Source Metadata Schema has an attribute ```preferred_term``` supporting UMLS concepts. Querying Sources supports a term to search for living sources who are male, such as ```metadata.living_source_data.preferred_term=Male```, and a query like:
```
GET https://search.api.sennetconsortium.org/param-search/sources?metadata.living_donor_data.preferred_term=Male
```
