# SenNet Donor schema

## Overview:
This page describes the Donor attributes available for querying via the [SenNet parameterized search endpoint]().  Full Donor schema information can be found at the [SenNet Search API documentation page](https://smart-api.info/ui/7aaf02b838022d564da776b03f357158) at the bottom of the page in the `Schemas` section under the Donor section.
This page describes the Donor schema for SenNet data. Donor data may be returned itself or a part of another entity.  For example, this endpoint searches Donors :
```
GET https://search.api.sennetconsortium.org/v3/param-search/donors?group_name=Stanford%20TMC
```

## Description: 
A query string is built by combining schema elements documented below with matching values.  Each "term" of the query is combined using the & character, and the entire query is attached to the base URL after a ? character, per web standards.

Query terms may be composited from attributes deeper in the schema type of an attribute.  For example, the Donor Schema attribute ```metadata.living_donor_data``` is has a type of Donor Metadata Schema, and Donor Metadata Schema has an attribute ```preferred_term``` supporting UMLS concepts. Querying Donors supports a term to search for living donors who are male, such as ```metadata.living_donor_data.preferred_term=Male```, and a query like:
```
GET https://search.api.sennetconsortium.org/v3/param-search/donors?metadata.living_donor_data.preferred_term=Male
```
