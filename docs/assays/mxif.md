# SenNet Multiplexed Immunofluorescence (MxIF)

### Last Updated 6/15/2020

## Overview
This document details MxIF data states, metadata fields, file structure, QA/QC thresholds, and data processing.

## Description 
MxIF is used to visualize the distribution of multiple protein antigens in an intact tissue sample by labeling them with fluorescently-tagged antibodies. In brief, tagged antibodies are iteratively incubated with a tissue section, visualized with a fluorescence microscope and then stripped.

## Definitions
There are a variety of terms used in this document that may not be familiar to all researchers wanting to make use of the HubMap data. The following figures illustrate several of these terms:


![](/assays/images/mx1.png)  
*Figure 1: Diagrmatic representation of microscopy terms. The black box is an example slide or cover slip where the sample is located. Blue boxes are examples of “regions” or user defined imaging areas. For instance, if you want to image a specific structure in the tissue, you would designate a “region” over the structure. Red boxes are examples of “tiles” or the microscope “field of view”. The size of the tile is dependent on the microscope set up and objective. Tiles will fill the region. Because the field of view cannot be changed, tiles will overhang from the region, ensuring the entire region is imaged at the expense of extra tiles being acquired.*

*Figure 2: Images are generally acquired with adjacent tiles overlapping, as indicated by the dark regions in the image on the right above. Overlap enhances alignment of tiles for stitching to create a composite image, as shown in Figure 4 below.*

*Figure 3: Images of tiles are captured as the stage moves across the imaged region row by row (left) or via a serpentine (or snake-like) path (right).*

*Figure 4: Stitching is the process of aligning and merging neighboring image tiles into a single composite image.*

## Terms defined in this document

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
|  Intensity| Detector Counts|
|  Signal| Intensity produced by fluorescence, both endogenous and introduced|
|  Noise| Intensity not produced by light but electronic fluctuations or electronic background.|
|  Stitching| Image stitching is the process of combining multiple images (tiles) with overlapping fields of view to produce a single, large image.|
|  Alignment/Registration| Image registration is the process of transforming different images into one coordinate system. Registration of all channels in each cycle is performed.|
|  Deconvolution| Deconvolution refers to reversing the optical distortion that takes place in an optical microscope to sharpen images/ improve definition. Practically, deconvolution can also sharpen images that suffer from fast motion or jiggles during capturing.|
|  Channels| Name of the fluorescence excitation wavelengths used. May be expressed as a fluorophore name (e.g. DAPI, GFP, DsRED, Cy5), wavelength (e.g. 488, 540, 750), or color (e.g. green, red, blue).|
|  Cycles| A process of adding a round of antibodies, imaging the bound antibodies, stripping the antibodies, and washing away the released antibody.|
|  Regions| User defined imaging area.|
|  Autofluorescence/Background| Endogenous fluorescence signal.|
|  Fluorescence| Light produced by a fluorophore that is bound to an antibody tag.|
|  Z-stack| A series of images produced at different stage heights or z positions.|
|  X plane| Plane that determines width|
|  Y plane| Plane that determines height|
|  Z plane| Plane that determines depth|
|  Pitch| Distance between pixels|
|  Tile| Rectangular field-of-view (Figure 1).|
| Pixel| How close two objects can be and still be differentiated within an image. This is generally dependent upon the diffraction limit of light and the microscope objective.|
| Field of View| Angle through which light can reach the detector. Available imaging area without stage movement.|
| Background Subtraction| Subtraction of autofluorescence intensity from total intensity.|
