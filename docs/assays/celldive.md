# SenNet Cell DIVE Data (GE Research)

## Last Updated: 12/18/2020

This document details Cell DIVE data states, metadata fields, file structure, QA/QC thresholds, and data processing.

## Description: 
Cell DIVE multiplexed imaging is an antibody-based hyperplexed technique for studying spatial cell biology. In brief, the process consists of iterative cycles of staining with fluorescently-labeled antibodies, imaging, and dye inactivation. Automated image processing algorithms for image correction, background fluorescence subtraction, and registration of all multiplexed images allows for expression analysis of more than 60 proteins in a single tissue section at cellular/subcellular levels.

## Definitions: 
There are a variety of terms used in this document that may not be familiar to all HubMap users. The following figures illustrate several of these terms: 

![](/assays/images/dive1.png)

**Figure 1:** *Diagram of microscopy terms. The black box is an example slide or cover slip where the sample is located. Blue boxes are examples of “regions” or user defined imaging areas. For instance, if you want to image a specific structure in the tissue, you would designate a “region” over the structure. Red boxes are examples of “tiles” or the microscope “field of view”. The size of the tile is dependent on the microscope set up and objective. Tiles will fill the region. Because the field of view cannot be changed, tiles will overhang from the region, ensuring the entire region is imaged at the expense of extra tiles being acquired.*

**Figure 2:** *Images are generally acquired with adjacent tiles overlapping, as indicated by the dark regions in the image on the right above. Overlap enhances alignment of tiles for stitching to create a composite image, as shown in Figure 4 below.*

![](/assays/images/dive3.png)

**Figure 3:** *Images of tiles are captured as the stage moves across the imaged region row by row (left) or via a serpentine (or snake-like) path (right).*

![](/assays/images/dive4.png)

**Figure 4:** *Stitching is the process of aligning and merging neighboring image tiles into a single composite image.*

![](/assays/images/dive5.png)

**Figure 5:** *Deep learning based nuclei segmentation. An encoder-decoder based deep learning model was used for nuclei segmentation. Multiscale Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) as feature map was derived from DAPI images was used for training the encoder-decoder deep learning framework of three levels. Max pooling was applied at all the levels for relevant feature selection in the encoding phase and drop-out was used to reduce over fitting.*

## Terms defined in this document:
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
|  Intensity| Detector Counts|
|  Signal| Intensity produced by fluorescence, both endogenous and introduced|
|  Noise| Intensity not produced by light but electronic fluctuations or electronic background.|
|  Stitching| Image stitching is the process of combining multiple images (tiles) with overlapping fields of view to produce a single, large image.|
|  Alignment/Registration| Image registration is the process of transforming different images into one coordinate system. Registration of all channels in each cycle is performed.|
|  Dedistortion| Dedistortion refers to reversing the optical distortion that takes place in an optical microscope to sharpen images/ improve definition. Practically, a calibration plate with appropriate artifacts is used to determine optical distortion coefficients that are then applied as per the model. |
|  Channels| Name of the fluorescence excitation wavelengths used. May be expressed as a fluorophore name (e.g. DAPI, GFP, DsRED, Cy5), wavelength (e.g. 488, 540, 750)
|  Cycles| A process of adding a round of fluorescently-labeled antibodies, imaging, and dye inactivation.|
|  Regions| User defined imaging area.|

The following metadata files reside in the parent study folder.

| File | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
|Slide_list.txt|A list of slides used in the study.|Such as: S20030077, S20030078, S20030079, S20030080, S20030081|
|Channel_list.txt|A list of original image paths. |Such as: RegisteredImages/S002/S002_mono_dapi_reg_pyr16_region_,DAPI_INIT AFRemoved/AE1_AFRemoved_pyr16_region_,AE1|

Antibody Metadata: Each TMC will provide:
- an antibody_metadata.tsv for antibody info AND 
- a file listing each antibody name, respective cycle and channel. 

This metadata file will then inform later processes at the HIVE and be used for labeling. Further, we aim to curate the final antibody list with expert interpretation of redundant names to make antibodies and markers a searchable criteria within the SenNet database. (Section 6 below)

## SenNet Cell DIVE Raw File Structure:
The general structure of the level 0 (raw) data produced by the GE Research Cell DIVE software is shown in the image below. 

![](/assays/images/dive6.png)

Segmentation files are included among the processed data contributed by the TMC’s and can be found in the following locations: 
| Type of Segmentation/Description | Descriptor (the name should contain the following) | Location |
|---|---|---|
|Nuclei segmentation from dapi images|Dapi_Slidexx_regionxx_nucseg.tif|Seg_and_quant_results/segmentation|

## Cell DIVE Processing by the HIVE:
The HIVE data processing pipeline documentation are to be determined as of 12/18/2020.

## QA/QC of processed microscopy data (state 1):
QC for the Cell DIVE process as performed by GE Research is performed on the processed microscopy data (state 1).  
 
Files submitted will be in OME format and can be checked in the following ways: 
1.         There should be a region directory for each donor under the SenNet_OME directory
2.         Each region should contain a number of OME TIFFS equal to the number of sections taken from the block of all donors, with each file identified by the corresponding slide ID.  The full list of all slide IDs (i.e. one section per slide) is found in the root directory in the file slide_list.txt
3.        Each OME tiff file should contain a number of channels equal to the number of markers plus two (the two additional channels being the initial and the final dapi images).  The list of channels is contained in the file channel_list.txt in the data set root directory
4.       There should be an OME TIFF file for each slide in the vHE (virtual H&E)  directory.  These vHE files consist of a whole slide image for each of the slides in the data set.  The whole slide image for each slide should contain a number of distinct sections that corresponds to the number of donors in the data set.
 
For a visual assessment, each OME-TIFF can be opened in a suitable viewer (for example QuPath).  Each channel can be inspected for focus, contrast and the presence of any foreign debris obstructing the image.  Tissue loss can be inferred by comparing the dapi_init channel to the dapi_final channel.  Stitching artifacts such as mis-aligned tiles and an apparent significant quilting pattern can be determined visually as well.
 
For each specific channel, compare marker localization to the staining pattern observed in the batch control slide. This batch control slide should represent the tissue(s) used for the original antibody characterization and staining patterns should follow correct cell type localization for the target marker.
 
To avoid the presence of stitching artifacts it is critical that the imager be initially calibrated with a standard Cell DIVE™ calibration plate.  This plate includes targets to support corrections for optical distortion, slight stage and camera mis-alignment, and illumination non-uniformity.  If significant stitching artifacts are observed, consider rerunning the automated calibration routine before the next slide study is performed.
