For example, for the file is TOP/non-global/lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson the value of this field would be "./lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson". After ingest, these files will be copied to the appropriate locations within the respective dataset directory tree. This field is used for internal SenNet processing. Examples for GeoMx and PhenoCycler are provided in the File Locations documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2McSs9geA9Eli4QWQaB3c9R3wo5d5U1Xd57DWQfN5Q/edit#heading=h.1u82i4axggee |                                                                | False      |
