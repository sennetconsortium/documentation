| data_path                              | Textfield | The top level directory containing the raw and/or processed data. For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |                                                                | True       |
| capture_batch_id                       | Textfield | A lab-generated ID to identify which cells were captured at the same time.

In the case of the 10X Controller this could be the chip ID and would allow users the ability to determine which samples were processed together in a Chromium controller. It is recommended that data providers prefix the ID with the center name, to prevent values overlapping across centers.                                                                             |                                                                | True       |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                       |                                                                | True       |
