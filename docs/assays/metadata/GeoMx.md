For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |            | True       |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |            | True       |
| mapped_area_value                                   | Numeric        | For Visium, this is the area of spots that was covered by tissue within the captured area, not the total possible captured area which is fixed. For GeoMx this would be the area of the AOI being captured. For HiFi this is the summed area of the ROIs in a single flowcell lane. For CosMx, Xenium and Resolve, this is the area of the FOV (aka ROI) region being captured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |            | True       |

The path assumes the files are located in the "TOP/non-global/" directory. For example, for the file is TOP/non-global/lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson the value of this field would be "./lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson". After ingest, these files will be copied to the appropriate locations within the respective dataset directory tree. This field is used for internal SenNet processing. Examples for GeoMx and PhenoCycler are provided in the File Locations documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2McSs9geA9Eli4QWQaB3c9R3wo5d5U1Xd57DWQfN5Q/edit#heading=h.1u82i4axggee |            | True       |
