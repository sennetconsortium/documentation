<span style="color:#ba3030"><b>NOTE</b>: Several versions of this metadata schema have been created over time.  The (Latest) version contains most attributes, but there may be some deprecated attributes in the older versions for which data has been collected.  SenNet is in the process of creating a reference which combines all of these versions into a single view.  That reference will be available here once completed.</span>

| preparation_protocol_doi      | Textfield      | DOI for the protocols.io page that describes the assay or sample procurment and preparation. For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might include staining of a section through the creation of an OME-TIFF file. In this case the protocol would include any image processing steps required to create the OME-TIFF file.
