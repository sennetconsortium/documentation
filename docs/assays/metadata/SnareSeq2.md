| data_path                              | Textfield | The top level directory containing the raw and/or processed data. For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |                                                                | True       |
| number_of_pre-amplification_pcr_cycles | Numeric   | The number of PCR cycles run after the Chromium Controller step and prior to separating the suspension and initiating library construction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                | False      |
| metadata_schema_id                     | Textfield | The string that serves as the definitive identifier for the metadata schema version and is readily interpretable by computers for data validation and processing. Example: 22bc762a-5020-419d-b170-24253ed9e8d9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                | True       |
| preparation_protocol_doi               | Textfield      | DOI for the protocols.io page that describes the assay or sample procurment and preparation. For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might include staining of a section through the creation of an OME-TIFF file. In this case the protocol would include any image processing steps required to create the OME-TIFF file. Example: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2lyno9qvx9/v1                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                | True       |
| parent_sample_id                       | Textfield | Unique SenNet or SenNet identifier of the sample (i.e., block, section or suspension) used to perform this assay. For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                       |                                                                | True       |
