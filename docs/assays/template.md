# Provider-focused section

## Directories and Files

### Directory structure
* [ ] Structure the information as a table, exemplified below.
* [ ] When possible, an agreed-upon single assay-specific directory structure should be used rather than allowing for variable directory names with regular expressions (more conducive to downstream Data Consumer use).
* [ ] The directory structure should not include files. File definitions should happen in the “Files included” section where files can be more appropriately documented.
* [ ] *THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS AN EXAMPLE — EDIT AS APPROPRIATE.*

Directory Name | Level | Required? | Description
------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------
raw | 0 | yes | This is the raw, unmodified files coming from the instrument (e.g., Akoya system). [*Populated by the data provider*] 
lab | 1 | yes | Processed files produced by the lab that generated the data. [*Populated by the data provider*]
lab/demultiplexed | 1.1 | yes | The demultiplexed files.
lab/processed | 1.2 | yes | The output from the primary analysis pipeline.
hive | 2 | yes | Processed files produced by HIVE using the common pipeline. [*Populated by the HIVE*]
hive/processed | 2.1 | yes | Image data that has been stitched and aligned and has undergone background subtraction and deconvolution.

### Files Included
* [ ] Structure the information as a table, exemplified below.
* [ ] Files included (outside of the “lab” directory) should be agreed upon by the Assay Team and HIVE.
* [ ] When possible, “file types” should include a link to an external definition, as exemplified below.
* [ ] When relevant, include a link to the program or pipeline used to generate each file. The program or pipeline used should be detailed in the “pipeline or data processing” metadata section below.
* [ ]  If the program/pipeline will perform any QA/QC filtering of the data when generating the file, note this in the file description with additional details provided in the “Data processing pipeline” section below.
* [ ] Avoid regular expressions in file names unless absolutely necessary (e.g., to denote a batch of files as in a set of fastq files).
* [ ] Files containing the metadata should also be included when relevant, for example, the TSV with assay-level metadata, the antibodies TSV, a file with the pipeline parameters, etc.
* [ ] *THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS AN EXAMPLE — EDIT AS APPROPRIATE.

## Metadata
### Sample-level
* [ ] Any assay-specific considerations for the [sample-level metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yqgPaVsUNpEavZOgl0bZsiTBABuVXJtq/edit#gid=233528636) should be detailed here. This is a required documentation element. To avoid any confusion, you should explicitly state if there are no assay-specific considerations. Example fields that may warrant assay-level definitions are included below.
    
**Sample field name** | **Sample type** <br> [block; section; suspension] | **Definition**
-------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------
Processing time | |
Source storage time | |

### Assay-level
* [ ] This is the assay-specific metadata that’s included in the assay metadata TSV files.
* [ ] Please include full descriptions.
* [ ] Structure the information as a table, exemplified below.
* [ ] *THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS AN EXAMPLE — EDIT AS APPROPRIATE.

Field | Required? | Data type | Description
----- | ----------- | ----------- | --------
Visium permeabil- ization time value | yes | int | Time used for tissue permeabilization during RNA extraction from tissue in Step 1.1 of the Visium protocol.
Visium permeabil- ization time unit | yes | categorical | Unit of measure for “Visium permeabilization time value”.
Visium Staining Type | yes | categorical | Staining used on the accompanying Visium slide for acquisition of tissue morphology information. Standard is hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) for basic morphology information imaged in bright-field, but fluorescent probes might be used for mRNA or protein level measurements.
Amplification PCR Cycles | yes | int | Refers to the number of PCR cycles in the amplification step; this varies according to the target number cells captured

#### Assay-level categorical field values
 * [ ]  Categorical field options should be listed in the following table. 
	 *As the list will change over time, please coordinate the categorical lists with the HIVE.

### Antibody
 * [ ]  Link to the [Antibody TSV file](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/antibodies/).

### HIVE data processing pipeline
* [ ] This section is to be completed by the HIVE.
* [ ] All pipeline processing steps should be detailed in the table below, including all parameter values used, as exemplified below.
* [ ] A figure should be included, as relevant, to better elucidate the pipeline levels, with each level being fully described in the table.
* [ ] Yes/No — The pipeline will produce the processed files from raw without human intervention. If “No”, then the required steps (human interventions) need to be detailed here.
* [ ] This processing should detail any expected pre-processing of input file(s)?
* [ ] The description should include what the processing step achieves.
* [ ] Any manual interventions should be documented with links to publications, as relevant.
* [ ] *THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS AN EXAMPLE — EDIT AS APPROPRIATE.

### Lab data processing pipeline
* [ ] The same details as provided in the above section (“HIVE data processing pipeline”) should be detailed for each lab that uploads data that is processed independently from the HIVE.
* [ ] Do not include the lab-processing details here; but rather include this lab-specific processing table of information with your data upload.
* [ ] In the Files section, describe any files that include the details of the lab-processing pipeline.
