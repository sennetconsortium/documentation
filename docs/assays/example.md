## Assay Description
Primary Reference [PMCIDs]( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) **PMC8647621**

### Technology Overview
* [ ] **CODEX is a strategy for generating highly multiplexed images using traditional fluorescent imaging. In brief, antibodies to antigens of interest are labeled with unique oligonucleotide barcodes. The barcoded antibodies are then applied to a tissue sample where they bind to target antigens. Using a microfluidics robot integrated with a fluorescent microscope, complementary oligonucleotide probes tagged with fluorophores are introduced to the tissue sample in groups of three antigen-specific probes at a time, allowing hybridization to the barcodes on the target antibodies. Tissue images are captured in each fluorescent channel, the fluorophore-tagged probes are gently removed, and then the process is repeated until all antigens have been visualized. DAPI is imaged during each cycle, enabling generation of a composite image with up to 50 protein targets co-registered on a single tissue section.**

### Key Definitions
* [ ] **Important terms used to describe CODEX data acquisition are defined and illustrated in the figures below.

##### Figure 1: Schematics illustrating CODEX-related terminology.

* [ ] **(A) The selected imaging region is automatically divided into tiles (individual fields of view). 
* [ ] **(B) Images are acquired with adjacent tiles overlapping (e.g., 30%), as indicated by shaded regions, to enhance image alignment. Images are captured as the stage moves across the region row by row or via a serpentine path. 
* [ ] **(C) Stitching is the process of aligning and merging tiles into a single composite image. 
* [ ] **(D) Multiple z planes (depths) are acquired at each (x,y) tile position. 
* [ ] **(E) Segmentation algorithms, utilized during image processing, are used to visualize predicted cell boundaries based on nuclear and/or other cell morphology markers.**

Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Alignment or registration | Process of transforming different images into one coordinate system (registration of all channels in each cycle is performed)
Autofluorescence | Endogenous fluorescence signal from tissue
Background subtraction | Subtraction of autofluorescence intensity from total intensity
Channels | Refers to the fluorescence excitation wavelengths used (e.g., 488, 540, 750); may also be by corresponding fluorophore names (e.g., DAPI, GFP, dsRED, Cy5)
CODEX |CO-Detection by inDEXing
Cycle | The process of adding three oligonucleotide-conjugated fluorophores to a tissue section in order to image the complementary-conjugated antibodies, then gently removing the fluorophores so a new set of antibodies can be visualized
Deconvolution | Process of reversing the optical distortion that takes place in an optical microscope to “sharpen” images and improve definition
Fluorescence  | Light produced by a fluorophore that is bound to an oligonucleotide tag
Noise | Intensity not produced by light but electronic fluctuations or electronic background
Pitch | Distance between z-slices (images in z-stack)
Pixel | The smallest adjustable point of a rasterized image (resolution refers to the number of pixels in an image)
Region | User-defined imaging area
Signal | Intensity (detector counts) produced by fluorescence, both endogenous and introduced
Stitching | Process of combining multiple, overlapping fields of view (tiles) to generate a single, composite image of the tissue region
Tile | Rectangular field of view acquired at imaging magnification
X plane | Plane that determines width
Y plane | Plane that determines height
Z plane | Plane that determines depth
Z-stack | A series of images produced at different stage heights or positions along the z-axis

## Directories and Files

### Directory structure
* [ ] Structure the information as a table, exemplified below.
* [ ] When possible, an agreed-upon single assay-specific directory structure should be used rather than allowing for variable directory names with regular expressions (more conducive to downstream Data Consumer use).
* [ ] The directory structure should not include files. File definitions should happen in the “Files included” section where files can be more appropriately documented.

Directory Name | Level | Required? | Description
---------------|-------|-----------|------------
raw/src|1|yes|This is the raw, unmodified files coming from the instrument (e.g., Akoya system). [*Populated by the data provider.*]
lab/drv| |yes|Processed files produced by the lab that generated the data. [*Populated by data providers.*]
lab/processed|2|yes|Image data that has been stitched and aligned and *optionally* has undergone background subtraction and deconvolution.
lab/segmented|3|no|Computationally predicted boundaries of cellular (nucleus, cytoplasm) and/or anatomical structures.
hive| |yes|Processed files produced by HIVE using the common pipeline. [*Populated by the HIVE.*]
hive/processed|2|yes|Image data that has been stitched and aligned and has undergone background subtraction and deconvolution.
hive/segmented|3|yes|Computationally predicted boundaries of cellular (nucleus, cytoplasm) and/or anatomical structures.

### Files Included
* [ ] Structure the information as a table, exemplified below.
* [ ] Files included (outside of the “lab” directory) should be agreed upon by the Assay Team and HIVE.
* [ ] *When possible, “file types” should include a link to an external definition, as exemplified below.
* [ ] When relevant, include a link to the program or pipeline used to generate each file. The program or pipeline used should be detailed in the “pipeline or data processing” metadata section below.
* [ ]  If the program/pipeline will perform any QA/QC filtering of the data when generating the file, note this in the file description with additional details provided in the “Data processing pipeline” section below.
* [ ] Avoid regular expressions in file names unless absolutely necessary (e.g., to denote a batch of files as in a set of fastq files).
* [ ] Files containing the metadata should also be included when relevant, for example, the TSV with assay-level metadata, the antibodies TSV, a file with the pipeline parameters, etc.
