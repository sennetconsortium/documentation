# SenNet Software Documentation

SenNet offers several software and tool components for programmatic access to SenNet data and metadata. This site
contains information about this software and tools, more information is available at
the [SenNet Consortium Site](https://sennetconsortium.org/) or
the [SenNet Data Sharing Portal](https://data.sennetconsortium.org).

For a comprehensive overview of SenNet data, please visit the [Data Overview](/data-sankey){:target="_blank"} page. This Sankey diagram
presents detailed information about published primary datasets, which are the initial sets of data directly collected
from a murine or human assay, such as histology, single-cell RNAseq, spatial transcriptomics, or proteomics. The
interactive nature of the diagram enables users to select specific nodes, which redirect to the Data Sharing Portal with
predefined faceted search options. Due to the intricate nature of the data, it is cached on an hourly basis, ensuring
that the data viewed may not always be the most current.

## [Data Submission Guide](/data-submission)
Instructions for TMCs, Assay teams, and others who need to upload data to the SenNet Data Sharing Portal.
