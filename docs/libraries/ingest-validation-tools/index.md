# Ingest Validation Tools & Upload Guidelines

**PLEASE NOTE:** The SenNet CODCC is in the process of adapating next-generation assay metadata and directory schemas by the [Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR)](https://metadatacenter.org/) for the [Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/). **The most up-to-date index of assay directory and directory schemas applicable to SenNet** can be found [here](https://software.docs.hubmapconsortium.org/metadata).

An exception to the above is the [murine source metadata schema](/libraries/ingest-validation-tools/schemas/source-murine), which is unique to SenNet and must be completed for registered murine sources.

Please reach out to the [SenNet Help Desk](mailto:help@sennetconsortium.org) with any questions.
