# Getting Started with Data Submission

Are you new to the data submission process in SenNet or looking for a refresher? Then this is the resource for you!

First, here are some key concepts and definitions:
- **Data Submission**: The process whereby data providers from SenNet funded components register sources (whole mice and humans), whole organs, tissue blocks, tissue sections, tissue suspensions, and datasets containing raw data files on the [SenNet Data Sharing Portal](https://data.sennetconsortium.org/search?size=n_10000_n&sort%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=last_modified_timestamp&sort%5B0%5D%5Bdirection%5D=desc). Data Submission also involves protocol registration (case selection, sample preparation, and experimental modality) in the SenNet workspace on [protocols.io](protocols.io) as well as file transfer via Globus.
- **Entity**: Anything that can be described using information.
- **Metadata**: Literally "information about information" or "data about data." Descriptive information about various entities submitted to the CODCC via TSV files.
- **Source**: The entire human, mouse, human organoid, or murine organoid from which samples are collected.
- **Sample**: An organ, tissue block, tissue section, or tissue suspension.
- **Dataset**: Contains the data files for a particular run of an experimental modality (assay). Note that SenNet Curation will use "experimental modality" and "assay" interchangeably.
