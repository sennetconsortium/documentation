### Data Source
Source metadata is supplied from each data generating site as either a PDF supplied by the organ procurement organization (OPO) or a downloaded and then de-identified extract from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) system or as csv files with available data (generally live surgical sources).  To provide documents for sources contact the help desk at help@sennetconsortium.org and a landing space will be provided where the data can be uploaded securely.

### Data Extraction and Transformation
Source metadata is manual-abstracted by the HIVE into the format described in this document into a single spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel, then exported as CSV, and finally ingested into the SenNet Provenance Graph as source metadata associated with the applicable SenNet Source Entity. Assignment of Concepts, Codes, and Terms in the manual-abstraction follows the principles of using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concepts which are common to multiple vocabularies when possible and favoring the use of SNOMEDCT_US. Source-level data in the first release are limited to those that appear once per source (e.g. demographics, but not vital signs or lab tests that repeat). The generally common source-level data across OPOs was abstracted in the first release as the source metadata. 


## Metadata schema

### Field types
- *Boolean* fields can be given as `TRUE`/`FALSE`, `True`/`False`, `true`/`false`, or `1`/`0`.

## Format

### `donor_id`
This is the SenNet ID of the source (e.g. SNT579.RPKF.738)

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |

### `source_name`
What type of data source this data comes from.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| enum | `organ_donor_data` |

### `start_datetime`
This is the approximate time difference in seconds between the procurement and the start of this event (this is to construct time series records of clinical data for event-level data not donor-level data). This is zero or blank in all data in first release.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `number` |
| required | `False` |

### `end_datetime`
This is the approximate time difference in seconds between the procurement and the end of this event (this is to construct time series records of clinical data for event-level data not donor-level data). This is zero or blank in all data in first release.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `number` |
| required | `False` |

### `graph_version`
This is the version of the HuBMAP Knowledge Graph that the Concept appears in (not limited to UMLS-Graph in future but only UMLS2019AA in first release).

| --- | --- |
| required | `False` |
| type | `string` |

### `grouping_concept`

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| type | `string` |

### `grouping_concept_preferred_term`
This is the preferred display term for the facet in which this record should be counted for faceted search in the portal. It may or may not correspond to a term in UMLS for the grouping concept.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `False` |
| type | `string` |

### `grouping_code`
This is a Code from a source vocabulary in the HuBMAP Knowledge Graph (not limited to UMLS vocabulary codes in future but only UMLS source vocabulary codes in first release). This code corresponds to the grouping_concept.
