Features available on the XAC Sankey visualization include:
- Draggable nodes
- Clickable nodes, labels and links that redirect to the SenNet Data Portal with selected filters
- Clear distinction between which nodes or links are clickable by change of mouse cursor and/or text color updates
- Mouseover title tooltips

The `xac-sankey` is available for usage at its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/data-sankey). 
The package is fully configurable, with the ability to set endpoints, column names, colors themes, events callbacks and much more. 
The package currently has two adapters available for easy integration in SenNet and HuBMAP projects. These also provide usage examples for developers.

The available data sankey diagram can be seen live on the [data overview page](/data-sankey).
